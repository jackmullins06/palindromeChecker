# Palindrome Checker

A simple C++ program that checks whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

## Getting Started

To run the program, simply compile the source code (`palindrome.cpp`) and execute the resulting binary. You will be prompted to enter a string to check for palindromicity.

## How it Works

The program works by reversing the input string and comparing it to the original string. If the reversed string is the same as the original string, then the input is a palindrome.

## Usage

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a string. Enter the string you wish to check, and press enter. The program will then determine whether the string is a palindrome or not, and print out a message to the console.

## Example Output

Please enter a string:
racecar
The string you entered is a palindrome!

Please enter a string:
hello
The string you entered is not a palindrome!
